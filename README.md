# Q-Learning-Project
What is Q Learning? What does the Q stand for (and what about the "Learning")?
Q learning is a model-free, value-based, off-policy algorithm that will find the best series of actions based on the agent's current state. The Q in Q learning stands for quality.
What is RL (Reinforcement Learning) and how does it relate to ML (Machine Learning)?
RL and ML are both kinds of AI. RL uses random trial and error and receives rewards or penalties based on its output. The RL model tries to maximize its reward. ML uses labeled and unlabeled pairs.
What does it mean for Q Learning to be "model-free"?
RL is model-free because it does not learn any models and only uses the q-values of actions.
What, if anything, is Q Learning often used for? (If you find any cool projects or research relating to Q Learning, feel free to link them to me!)
